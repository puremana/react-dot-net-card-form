## Things I would do it in a real project situation

- Use Stripe React JS to create the form in React (https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/react)

- Likely not send credit card details in database. This would be handled by sending the card details to stripe directly which returns a token which you can use

## Things I didn't have time for or didn't complete

- I had trouble getting the tests for my dot net API working and therefore left them incomplete

- Spend more time on accessability

- Get CORS issues solved

- Limit inputs to certain max lengths (3 for CVC, 19 for credit card)

- Have submit action
